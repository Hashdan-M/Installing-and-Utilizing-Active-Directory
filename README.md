<h1>Utilizing Active Directory</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Active Directory is a core tool for system administrators who need to manage Windows machines. Active Directory allows us to manage users, groups, machines, and the policies that apply to all of them in a centralized fashion.
In this lab, we'll interact with Active Directory, use it to add users and groups, edit users memberships as well as create a new group policy object (GPO).
